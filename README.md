* https://us.isabelmarant.com/products/cl001jfac4c14a01bk-floricia-tights-black these tights i want, but if i get one small hole in them, and then its a waste, but still u know ill enjoy them, so, a big maybe -- ill get them, i have a couple of things i want to do on my to-do list (e.g. replace my curtain rod bc its bent lol) then ill reward myself with tights, like wednesday-ish that will be my goal. im not a crazy shopper, i def have limits, im not a hoarder either, im an anti-hoarder, i think with makeup yeah its like u want to find the right color that works on u so u have to experiment a lot but i think alot before i end up buying something, but so anyway i dont want to come off as that, i like making money with my hard work but i like saving money too, i really think for tights $250 is a bit much, but they are niceee and i do want them
* theyre pretty sturdy, i wasnt in the mood to wear them all month until the day b4 thanksgiving bc we did our dinner a day earlier bc my bro + sil had a flight the next day, but, i think they will last awhile

* i donated all of the clothes i use to wear at penn/philly many yrs ago, i think the only thing i kept was the sweater i wore when i moved in to my apartment in philly. i didnt want to remember any of that, all of it, everything single thing i donated. nothing i wear reminds me of that shithole and shithole experience which i got nothing out of, absolutely nothing.

* i told myself i wouldnt wear any of my penn/philly clothes to my interviews i had in 2017 and onward, nothing, all new things

* some things i have from hs or rutgers 😇 and im like ohhh yeah my mom got me this, all i did was point to it at the store and shes like "okayyyy only if u wear it" and it was like $200 or more, i still have it and i still wear it. actually i have this black skirt with gold sequin horizontal thick stripes that my mom got for me in hs, we both love that skirt still, i'll pull it out when we go to dinner where it would look nice

i got the things, i just have to fix my curtain rod later or this week, my mom gave me a new one a while ago, but there was a big thing on my to-do list that i did do yesterday, sooo i got the things

the tights came in the mail today, okk def overpriced haha as expected but i like themm, i got another pair from a diff website by the same french designer that are in gold but they were a little discounted BUT they're originally $450. i think i just want to work on my app this weekend too, i really want to figure out things, maybe next weekend or next next weekend. gotta get to that cafe early tho bc it gets packed and ppl start moving the furniture around.

want https://www.revolve.com/commando-faux-patent-leather-legging-in-mauve/dp/CMAN-WP125/ but havent decided on the color, they have white (maybe), black (works with everything) but pink also looks fun. got them in black yesterday, ill play around with all of these things during/after thanksgiving. i work hard and then i play hard, right now, i have to work hard.

im super busy this weekend and this whole week with my app, i havent tried those tights on yet but i got a dress to match them for thanksgiving 😬

i got this the other day but it wont be delivered for another week https://www.revolve.com/loveshackfancy-natasha-dress-in-black/dp/LESH-WD133/ this with the isabel marant tights in black is the general goal ... all black but gold gianvito rossi gold heels that i have already, thats the plan but im busy i really dont want to get distracted by anything

i got this 2 yrs ago?? https://www.revolve.com/dyson-airwrap-multistyler-complete-long-in-nickel-copper/dp/DYSR-WU6/ ONLY USED IT ONCE bc its kind of complicated, theres all these different parts, im going to pull it out and figure it out after im done and for thanksgiving. i have the other two things by dyson tho, the hairdryer i got in bethesda and then the airstraight i use most of the time but my hair straightner makes my hair shiny tho which that thing doesnt do anyway i was having a conversation about dyson with my brother, he said that he's well respected in the engineering world, makes good stuff imo, i dunno why i havent figured out that airwrap thing its just sitting around

https://www.jenniferbehr.com/products/kason-headband-black-gold?variant=Black%20Gold& got this, its so pretty, omggg and its a little heavy, maybe a mob-wife vibe or like with a pretty dress

i got this the other day https://www.revolve.com/fazit-beauty-wing-eyes-in-golden/dp/FBEA-WU9/ want to try this, it transfers from the paper to your eyelids, looks interesting 😬

https://www.gianvitorossi.com/us_en/woman/shoes/sandals/bijoux/G61635.15RIC.NAPNERO.html these im going to get in black, but i want to try them on first, theyre really popular so theyre not in stock esp not at the short hills mall @ neiman. im going to get them, im just waiting to see if theres going to be a post new years day sale @ neiman or saks etc why bc i want to put both the gold ones and the black ones in the same shopping cart and hit checkout hahaha theyre a good investment, leather is always a good investment

* "Gianvito Rossi Bijoux heels, particularly the SS21 sandals, are praised for their stunning, unique design, versatility with evening wear, and surprisingly good comfort for a high heel, thanks to substantial straps. However, while generally considered a comfortable brand, some users experience issues like the sole's sock peeling, raising quality concerns for the price, though the distinct look and feel often outweigh these potential construction flaws for fans."
* if theyre comfy ill get them in gold as well lololl

* https://www.revolve.com/fleur-du-mal-silk-and-lace-scallop-midi-skirt-in-black/dp/FLER-WQ42/ i want to get this black silk skirt, like i need it lol BUT its made in china so why is it so overpriced, i dont get it
* i want to get a fun pastel pink dress to offset this lame winter

im going to get this https://leletny.com/products/liv-headband bc i remembered i wanted this a couple of yrs ago then i forgot, where r they located in nyc i wanna see it in person
* omg they have appts available https://leletny.com/pages/showroom-appointments -> personal styling, that could be fun actually, maybe in jan/feb
* i need a headband in like a dark red and also a green, like an olive-y/moss-y green https://www.jenniferbehr.com/collections/headbands/products/natasha-headband-olive and/or https://www.saksfifthavenue.com/product/lelet-ny-heloise-velvet-padded-headband-0400001519565.html one or both i will get

https://www.freepeople.com/shop/loveshackfancy-ilene-satin-lace-maxi-skirt/ i got this in pink 😇

https://www.jenniferbehr.com/collections/sale/products/stefanya-headband-golden i got this, it looks like it was made in pakistan or india, but they hand make them in nyc, totally my thing

https://www.mansurgavriel.com/products/maxi-everyday-cabas-black this im getting bc it can fit my 16" macbook pro, it just doesnt have a zipper on the top to which my dad was like, "what if ur bag falls when ure in the subway and everything falls out" -> and i was like noo im going to keep everything inside it in smaller bags lol, w/e nothing is perfect, i think ill need a case for my laptop bc what if it rains i dunno i have one tho, def getting the black one, pebbled leather. u know, they dont make women's LEATHER bags that can hold the 16" macbook pro too often, just crazy, for men they do tho, insane. i have a couple of bags from this brand and i really like them, i have these green shoes by them too from a few yrs ago, theyre nyc based. i wanted to see it in person tho, i dunno, want to get it, but also a little on the fence

deciding between https://us.isabelmarant.com/products/bk0013fac3e08sleec-beth-sneakers-leopard-ecru vs https://us.isabelmarant.com/products/bk0013faa1e21s20wh-beth-sneakers-white leaning towards white but the leopard ones look fun lol im a very high heel person but sometimes i need white sneakers, theres a look where u wear a sweatshirt with a nice skirt, then white sneakers i want to do that in the spring
* https://www.mytheresa.com/media/1094/1238/100/94/P01070710_d2.jpg i think the leopard stands out too much, white would be cleaner
* i dont want to choose, i want to get both lol, what if i do, i have savings, i can do that. grab coffee in leopard print sneakers and then the next day go to the mall in white sneakers u know
