# should-i-get-this-or-not

* https://us.isabelmarant.com/products/cl001jfac4c14a01bk-floricia-tights-black these tights i want, but if i get one small hole in them, and then its a waste, but still u know ill enjoy them, so, a big maybe -- ill get them, i have a couple of things i want to do on my to-do list (e.g. replace my curtain rod bc its bent lol) then ill reward myself with tights, like wednesday-ish that will be my goal. im not a crazy shopper, i def have limits, im not a hoarder either, im an anti-hoarder, i think with makeup yeah its like u want to find the right color that works on u so u have to experiment a lot but i think alot before i end up buying something, but so anyway i dont want to come off as that, i like making money with my hard work but i like saving money too, i really think for tights $250 is a bit much, but they are niceee and i do want them

* i donated all of the clothes i use to wear at penn/philly many yrs ago, i think the only thing i kept was the sweater i wore when i moved in to my apartment in philly. i didnt want to remember any of that, all of it, everything single thing i donated. nothing i wear reminds me of that shithole and shithole experience which i got nothing out of, absolutely nothing.

* i told myself i wouldnt wear any of my penn/philly clothes to my interviews i had in 2017 and onward, nothing, all new things

* some things i have from hs or rutgers 😇 and im like ohhh yeah my mom got me this, all i did was point to it at the store and shes like "okayyyy only if u wear it" and it was like $200 or more, i still have it and i still wear it. actually i have this black skirt with gold sequin horizontal thick stripes that my mom got for me in hs, we both love that skirt still, i'll pull it out when we go to dinner where it would look nice

i got the things, i just have to fix my curtain rod later or this week, my mom gave me a new one a while ago, but there was a big thing on my to-do list that i did do yesterday, sooo i got the things

the tights came in the mail today, okk def overpriced haha as expected but i like themm, i got another pair from a diff website by the same french designer that are in gold but they were a little discounted BUT they're originally $450. i think i just want to work on my app this weekend too, i really want to figure out things, maybe next weekend or next next weekend. gotta get to that cafe early tho bc it gets packed and ppl start moving the furniture around.

want https://www.revolve.com/commando-faux-patent-leather-legging-in-mauve/dp/CMAN-WP125/ but havent decided on the color, they have white (maybe), black (works with everything) but pink also looks fun
